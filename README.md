## Welcome to the Repository for the MagTOC.ml GitHub Project Website

To learn more about this #DigitalHumanities and #AI/#ML (#MachineLearning) project, please visit our project homepage here: https://MagTOC.ml.

We will have more to share here in the weeks ahead. But for now, you can get a sense of our mission by viewing this short series of slides: https://bit.ly/early_MagTOCml_ideas.

In brief, this project is buiding a #GroundTruth dataset of TOCs -- Table of Contents -- pages of magazines in the digital collections of computer magazines at the Internet Archive here: https://archive.org/details/computermagazines. There are over 19,000 items in this collection of collections. An item is most likely an issue of one of the roughly 1,700 computer magazine periodicals. One goal of this project is to determine the accurate size and depth of these magazine collections.

By creating the MagTOCml dataset, we will be able to train a #MachineLearning model that can work with us to find and understand (accurately understande through text- and data-mining) the broad content of this rich cultural heritage resource.
