## SpotaTOC!

NOTE: The methodology of the Spot phase of the project is being redesigned. This page will be updated soon. We will be releasing a simple Python app to efficiently find and gather the TOC pages rather than rely on a Twitter based workflow.

Phase 1 in the **MagTOCml** project involves volunteer Twitter folk keeping an eye out for the Daily TOC Target tweets from the **@MagTOCml** Twitter account of this project. These tweets will include URL links to a small number of specific issues of magazines drawn from the massive *Computer Magazines* collection at the Internet Archive.

## Link to a Magazine Issue

Click a link in the Daily TOC Target tweet to go to that issue of the magazine at the Internet Archive. The link will open on the cover page of the target issue of the magazine. The *BookReader* viewer will attempt to simulate a page-turning view of reading a physical copy of the magazine. Depending on the display resolution and orientation of your device, you will see either a 1-up or 2-page view of the magazine once you turn past the cover page.

Page turning is done by clicking your mouse cursor or touchscreen tapping the displayed pages of the *BookReader* viewer. Click/touches to the right side of the view will advance the page. Left side click/touches will back up a page.

## Spot the TOC

Skim the first few pages of the target issue of the magazine until you spot the TOC (Table of Contents) page(or pages). Once you have spotted a TOC in the Archive's *BookReader* viewer of the target magazine, right-click (or long-press) on the page to pop up the context menu for the page and select the 'copy link' menu item.

### Tweet Reply with TOC Link
Return to your Twitter app or browser and reply to the @MagTOCml Daily Target tweet by pasting in the URL to the TOC page (or pages) that you found. While all we need is the URL to the specific TOC page, feel free to include any additional comments if you saw something interesting or unexpected on your TOC Hunt.

Note: If the target issue has a multi-page TOC, you will need to start your reply tweet and then return to the *BookReader* viewer to grab links to any additional pages to include in your reply. Most magazines have a single page TOC. A relatively small percentage use a 2-page "spread" design of a left-and-right page together. It is extremely rare to have more than a two-page spread TOC.
