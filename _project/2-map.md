## Map the TOC by Layout Parsing and Content Transcription

In the second phase of the **MagTOCml** project, we will be using a custom Ground Truth tool to perform layout analysis and content transcription of the spotted TOCs. This tool is under development and is an extension of the FactMiners Toolkit which has been under development in support of the **FactMiners** _Softalk Apple Project_.

Initially, this tool will be used by the project researchers to evolve and stabilize the MAGAZINEgts ground truth storage metadata format and the tool itself. Once the tool and format have achieved sufficient maturity to be packaged and used by fellow **#CitizenScientists**, we will welcome others to join this project to map the spotted TOCs.

There are tens of thousands of magazine issues in the _Computer Magazines_ collection at the Internet Archive. Once we have achieved critical mass of dataset structure and ground truth format, we will turn our attention on the astronomical number of non-computer magazines at the Archive.
