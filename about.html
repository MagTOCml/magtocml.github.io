      <p class="mb-2">The <strong>MagTOCml</strong> project is part of the <strong>FactMiners.org Digital Humanities</strong> reseach mission. Started by <em>Citizen Scientists</em> <strong>Jim Salmons</strong> and <strong>Timlynn Babitsky</strong>, we are an unfunded and independent group dedicated to the preservation and exploration of print era magazines with a focus on the digital collections at the Internet Archive.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">Our primary goal is the development of the <strong>MAGAZINEgts</strong> ground truth storage format and its reference implementation on the Apple Computer focused edition of <strong>Softalk</strong> magazine (1980-84).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">We will explain more about us and our project in the days ahead. For now, we're just focused on getting the project going.
